# Worklog — \<Project\>

**Goal:** \<target metric: speed, GFLOPs, etc.\>

---

## Setup
- Input: \<shape, precision\>
- Hardware: \<GPU type\>
- Metric: \<what you're measuring\>

## Baseline
Approach: <naive/reference implementation>
- Time: <...> ms
- Notes: \<bottleneck or correctness check\>


## Results
| Version | Change | Time (ms) | GFLOPs | Δ |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ------ | - |
| v0 | Baseline | <...> | <...> | — |
| v1 | <optimization> | <...> | <...> | +<x>% |
| v2 | <optimization> | <...> | <...> | +<x>% |
| v3 | <optimization> | <...> | <...> | +<x>% |

## Notes
- \<key learnings\>
- \<what worked / didn't work\>
- \<next steps\>
