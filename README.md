## Features 
- **Problems**: Solve 60+ challenges in CUDA, Triton, and Mojo across multiple difficulty levels. 
- **Benchmarking**: Run your solutions on actual GPUs (T4, H100, A100, etc.) with precise performance measurement.
- **Leaderboards**: Compare your performance against other developers on per-GPU rankings.
- **Baseline Comparisons**: See how your optimized kernels stack up against PyTorch, Triton, and other framework implementations
- **CLI Tool**: Submit and test solutions directly from your terminal with the Tensara CLI

## Sponsors

Thank you to our sponsors who help make Tensara possible:

- [Modal](https://www.modal.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=tensara) - Modal lets you run
jobs in the cloud, by just writing a few lines of Python. Customers use Modal to deploy Gen AI models at large scale,
fine-tune large language models, run protein folding simulations, and much more.

We use Modal to securely run accurate benchmarks on various GPUs.
